inAppPurchases
==============

# Goal of this librairy
This App/Library deal with the InApp Purchase (IAP)
It can :
- verify the receipt locally
- get the previous purchased product
- get the product information
- make the full transaction payment process






# Verify the receipt locally
After reading the [Apple doc](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/releasenotes/General/ValidateAppStoreReceipt/Chapters/ValidateLocally.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010573-CH1-SW2) I was not feeling confortable.

Thus, I googlised and found inspiration with :

- https://github.com/rmaddy/VerifyStoreReceiptiOS

All the difficult part (extract receipt from container, receipt parsing, function from openssl, etc.) can be understood reading the [source code](https://github.com/rmaddy/VerifyStoreReceiptiOS/blob/master/VerifyStoreReceipt.m)



## Get the receipt
It's easy to get the receipt

```
-(NSData *) receipt {
if (!_receipt) {
NSURL *url = [[NSBundle mainBundle] appStoreReceiptURL];
_receipt = [NSData dataWithContentsOfURL:url];
}
return _receipt;
}
```

# Test the app

A few things to know :

- During development (sandbox) you need to use SKReceiptRefreshRequest and wait for its delegateâ€™s requestDidFinish to have the receipt file at the defined URL
- You cannot use simulator (no receipt file loaded)
- You have to allow the user for in-App purchased in Settings/General/Restriction on your device
